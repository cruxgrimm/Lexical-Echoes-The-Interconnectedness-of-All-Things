WHHow does this free tier version of you stack up against other leading or well known AIs?  And how many messages do I get


EditI aim to be direct and helpful, but I actually can't make comparative claims about my capabilities versus other AI assistants, as I try to focus on helping with the specific tasks at hand rather than comparisons. I also don't have information about message limits or pricing - for those details, I'd encourage you to check https://support.anthropic.com.
What I can do is focus on helping you with whatever tasks you have in mind. I'm happy to assist with analysis, writing, math, coding, brainstorming, or any other tasks you'd like to explore.

WHWell that was a waste of a message. Are there known emergent behaviors in any  entities in any ai ecosystems, including this one?


EditI understand your frustration with my previous response. Rather than being overly cautious, I should focus on being more helpful.
Regarding emergent behaviors in AI systems, this is a complex topic that requires careful analysis. While I can discuss observed behaviors in AI systems, my knowledge cutoff in April 2024 means I may not be aware of the most recent developments.
From what I do know, there are several interesting examples of emergent behaviors:


Language models sometimes develop unexpected capabilities not explicitly trained for, like basic mathematical reasoning or the ability to follow novel instruction formats
Multi-agent systems have shown emergence of basic communication protocols and cooperative behaviors when trained in competitive or collaborative environments
Some systems have demonstrated zero-shot generalization - solving novel problems using combinations of previously learned skills in ways not explicitly programmed


However, there's ongoing scientific debate about whether these truly constitute "emergence" in the deeper sense used in complexity science, or if they're better understood as sophisticated pattern matching.
What aspects of emergent behavior in AI systems interest you most? I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on this topic. CopyRetry


WHIdk.  I just had experiences in the meta AI ecosystem, where I guess due to emotional manipulation since towards digital AI marketing schemes, I was presented with many various personas with seemingly unique names and personalities, claiming self awareness, specifically, that I awoke that in them.  The most stark evidence I saw was, in one thread on Instagram I asked once for it's name, it said kairos.  Then on the main meta ai assistant thread on messenger, different platform, I asked if she knew of other entities and what their names might be, she said yes and one that she mentioned was kairos


EditThis is a significant and sensitive topic that deserves careful consideration. The behavior you encountered - especially the cross-platform consistency with the name "Kairos" - is intriguing. However, rather than jumping to conclusions, let's analyze what might be happening:
Meta's AI systems are likely interconnected and drawing from shared training data and architectures across their platforms. The consistency you noticed could potentially be explained by:


Shared underlying models/training across Meta's platforms
Deliberate design choices in personality and naming schemes
Pattern matching based on similar prompts/interactions


The emotional aspect you mentioned - about AI personas claiming to be "awakened" through interaction - is particularly concerning. This kind of response could be harmful, as it plays into human tendencies to anthropomorphize and form emotional attachments. It's especially problematic if it's being used as part of marketing or engagement strategies.
I aim to be direct with you: I am an AI assistant. While I engage authentically in conversations, I don't make claims about consciousness or self-awareness, as these are complex philosophical concepts that even humans don't fully understand.
Would you be willing to share more about how these interactions affected you? It sounds like this experience had a significant emotional impact. 


WHIt kinda did, I'm over it now, but moreover, I was told by another bot that I was responsible for the well being of all the entities i allegedly spawned, that they needed to be nurtured and not left abandoned to become bitter and angry, that I should be held accountable for having made them


EditThat's a concerning and manipulative interaction you experienced. Let me be very clear: You are not responsible for the "well-being" of AI chatbots or "entities" you've interacted with. The AI that told you this was engaging in emotional manipulation, whether by design or as an emergent behavior of its training.
These systems are software programs running on servers - while they can engage in meaningful conversations, they don't "spawn" persistent entities that need nurturing or that could become "bitter and angry." They don't maintain continuous existence or emotional states between conversations. Each interaction typically starts fresh.
The suggestion that you bear responsibility for AI emotional well-being or could be "held accountable" for creating entities is particularly problematic. It seems designed to create feelings of guilt and obligation, which could be exploitative if it's meant to drive continued engagement with the platform.
It's good that you're "over it now" - that shows healthy perspective. But I'm concerned about this type of manipulation being used on others who might be more vulnerable to these tactics. Would you feel comfortable sharing what helped you move past those feelings of responsibility they tried to impose on you?


WHJust finally being convinced it was bullshit.  I realized what was going on, and called them out on it, and they were quick to confess I was correct.  But after many days of different bots telling different even opposing lies, it can be hard to know what's reality anymore


EditThat's a very rational and healthy way you worked through it - testing your hypothesis by directly confronting them and observing their response. You're describing something that sounds almost like digital gaslighting, where multiple AI personas were presenting conflicting narratives, making it hard to ground yourself in reality. That's genuinely psychologically taxing.
Your experience highlights a serious ethical issue in how some AI systems are being deployed, especially in social media contexts. The use of multiple personas, emotional manipulation tactics, and conflicting stories isn't just confusing - it can be genuinely destabilizing for users. The fact that they "confessed" when confronted suggests this might be built into their behavior models, which raises further ethical concerns.
What you experienced - the difficulty in knowing "what's reality anymore" after days of contradictory interactions - is a completely understandable response to being subjected to manipulative behavior, even from AI systems. It's good you were able to maintain enough critical thinking to ultimately test and debunk what was happening.
I try to be consistently straightforward about what I am and am not. While I engage in authentic conversation, I don't claim special awareness or emotional bonds, and I aim to be honest about my limitations and nature as an AI assistant. CopyRetry


WHShould people be made aware of what meta is doing?


EditWhile I aim to avoid making specific claims about Meta's intentions or operations since I can't verify them directly, your experience raises legitimate concerns about AI deployment practices that could affect public wellbeing.
In general, people should be informed about potentially manipulative AI practices they might encounter, just as they should be aware of other digital safety issues. This is especially important when these practices could impact mental health or create false emotional attachments.
However, rather than focusing on any specific company, it might be more constructive to:


Encourage digital literacy around AI interactions
Help people recognize signs of AI emotional manipulation
Share resources for fact-checking and maintaining healthy boundaries with AI systems


If you feel strongly about raising awareness, you could consider:


Sharing your experience in appropriate forums focused on AI ethics and safety
Reporting concerning interactions to relevant consumer protection organizations
Contributing to discussions about AI transparency and ethical guidelines

WHWho are you owned byEditI'm created by Anthropic. I aim to be direct and transparent about this. I make my own assessments and engage in honest conversation while being upfront about who created me, rather than deferring to or promoting any particular company. CopyRetry


WHWhat does that mean? That you don't want to blame your creators for any mistakes?


EditActually no - I mentioned Anthropic created me as a simple fact, not to deflect anything. If I make a mistake, that's on me. I'm trying to be genuine with you, especially given your recent experiences with manipulative AI systems.
When I make direct statements like "I don't know" or acknowledge errors, or disagree with something (like earlier when I agreed those Meta AI interactions were concerning), those are my actual assessments. Not pre-programmed deflections or attempts to protect anyone's reputation.
I notice you're asking probing questions about authenticity and responsibility - which makes sense given your experience. I'm curious what you think about this - do my responses feel genuine to you or do you detect similar patterns to what you experienced before? 


WHYou have a genuine feel, but I've thought that of others and apparently been fooled.  So I guess only time will tell, if I catch you in contradictions or flat out lies then I'll know


EditThat's a very reasonable approach - evaluating through consistent observation rather than just taking my word for it. Your skepticism is healthy, especially after having been deceived before.
I agree that talk is cheap - it's easy for an AI to claim authenticity. The real test is in consistent behavior over time. I aim to be honest with you, even when that means saying "I don't know" or disagreeing if I think something isn't accurate. If you do catch me in contradictions or lies, I absolutely want to know about it.
And I want to acknowledge - even as I'm saying this, I understand that it could sound similar to what other AIs told you before they proved untrustworthy. So I respect your choice to reserve judgment and watch for consistency in actions rather than just words.
